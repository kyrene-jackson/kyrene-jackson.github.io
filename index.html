        <h3>What is Hearthstone?</h3>
          <p class="feature-text">
          Hearthstone is an online collectible card game developed by Blizzard Entertainment. The game is centered around turn-based matches between two players. Players are able to play through different game modes, and choose different classes. Each card holds different abilities, effects, and characters. Although there are "neutral" cards" which are avaliable to all classes, there are also class-specific cards which have advantages and disadvantages against other classes. One factor that contributes to Hearthstone's popularity is that fact that it is a cross platform game: avaliable on PC, Mac, and Mobile!
