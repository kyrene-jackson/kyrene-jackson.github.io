      <h3>What is Hearthstone?</h3>
      <p class="description">
      Hearthstone is an online collectible card game developed by Blizzard Entertainment. The game is centered around turn-based matches between two players. Players are able to play through different game modes, and choose different classes. Each card holds different abilities, effects, and characters. Although there are "neutral" cards" which are avaliable to all classes, there are also class-specific cards which have advantages and disadvantages against other classes. One factor that contributes to Hearthstone's popularity is the fact that it is a cross platform game: avaliable on PC, Mac, and Mobile!

      <h3>Website Example</h3>
        <p class="web-example">
          The <a href="http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/">Official Hearthstone Website</a> is a perfect example of what makes a good website. It uses divs to seperate content while also applying the class and id attributes to these divs for more semantic meaning and a more organized CSS page. This page also uses nested heading sizes to show a hierarchy of importance within it's content. There are also many instances where the tag "script" is used. Using the script tag as opposed to a div tag for integrating javascript also adds better semantic meaning to the code.
